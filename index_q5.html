    <p>okay so basically the q5 client <a href="index.html">(here)</a> is the default one now</p>
    <p>hopefully clipping masks and text wrapping get added to q5.js soon because that's basically the only feature advantage over q5.js right now</p>
    <p>the p5 client should still work though <a href="index_p5.html">(here)</a></p>
    <br />
    <p>list of reasons to NOT use the p5 client:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>unminified, q5.js is about 126kb, p5.js is like... 5mb</li>
        <li>q5.js (q2d) has about 4x better performance than p5.js (p2d) and webgpu will be like 20x better</li>
        <li>q5.js colour support is better</li>
        <li><a href="https://substack.com/@quintonashley/p-152794191">the processing foundation just kinda sucks in general</a></li>
        <li>and probably more that I forgot lmao</li>
    </ul>
    <p>that being said, q5.js can have bugs not present in q5 sometimes</p>
