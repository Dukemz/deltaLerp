# deltaLerp (Scroller Game Test)

WORK IN PROGRESS!

This is a prototype scroller/shooter game using only simple polygons as sprites.

It's also a proof of concept to show that it's possible to make large HTML/JS games that run offline without the need to run a local server.

## Try It Yourself

To try the first test version, download dlpoffline.min.html and open it in your browser - no additional setup needed.

You can also optionally download the quackmp3.mp3 file and place it into a folder named assets in the same directory as the HTML, to test if audio is working.
