# deltaLerp (Scroller Game Test)

WORK IN PROGRESS!

This is a prototype scroller/shooter game using only simple polygons as sprites.

It's also a proof of concept to show that it's possible to make large HTML/JS games that run offline without the need to run a local server.

## Try the game

You can run the latest build [here](https://dukemz.github.io/deltaLerp/), or clone/[download](https://github.com/Dukemz/deltaLerp/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the repository and open index.html.

Be aware that the latest build is considered bleeding-edge and will likely be unstable.

If you download/clone the repository, a live server shouldn't be necessary to run the game, but some errors may be vague due to CORS limitations. 

## Offline Single File Demo

To try the single-file proof of concept, download dlpoffline.min.html from the offlinemode folder and open it in your browser - no additional setup needed.

You can also optionally download the quackmp3.mp3 file and place it into a folder named assets in the same directory as the HTML, to test if audio is working.
